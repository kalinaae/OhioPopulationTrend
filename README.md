# ActualTakeHomeExam

This is a program that produces the three counties with the highest and lowest populations in 2010 and 2019 across two age groups. This can be used to look at trends in population, overall and within the young/older populations.

This program shows that Ohio's population is mostly increasing, especially in more urban counties such as Delaware and Franklin County, but the rate at which is increasing is different among age groups. Some counties, specifically Jefferson, Carroll and Monroe County have an overall declining population. We see that the population change in younger people is smaller than the change in the older category, indicating that most counties have an older population and younger people are not staying in the county that long. For example, in Delaware County the under 20 population grew by 24% between 2010 and 2019 and the 65+ population grew by almost 77% in Delaware County. In conclusion, the older population is growing faster than the younger population.
