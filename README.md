# ActualTakeHomeExam

This is a program that produces the three counties with the highest and lowest populations in 2010 and 2019 across two age groups. This can be used to look at trends in population, overall and within the young/older populations.

This program shows that Ohio's population is increasing, especially in more urban counties such as Delaware and Franklin County. Some counties, specifically Jefferson, Carroll and Monroe County have an overall declining population. We see that the population change in younger people is smaller than the change in the older category, indicating that most counties have an older population and younger people are not staying in the county that long. 

*Note: the other repo labeled "TakeHomeTest" was just submitted for the in class assignment, this repo is being created to store the Take Home Test.*
